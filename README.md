### Hi ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile.
As you can see, it's pretty empty repos wise. This is because I don't like to make my projects public before they're pretty much done.
Also I'm not even working on any of them currently, busy with other things.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a 3D web app
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Game Dev, Qt and 3D on the web (all three not related)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with designing my personal website (CV kind of website)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about video games in general
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Discord: Zenwoh; Twitter: Zenwoh
- âš¡ Fun fact: My sleep schedule is literally non existant right now :)
